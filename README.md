# Elm Conf 2019 Slides

## Music Theory With Types

I am using RevealJS to do these slides. I will be able to embed demos directly into the slides.

## TODO:

I plan on organizing the slides using the 11ty SSG. I can rip out a lot of the client side rendering and have 11ty process it.

I can also use my LilyPond rendering plugin to create music examples to explain things.
