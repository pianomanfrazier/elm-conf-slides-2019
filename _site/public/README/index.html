<h1>Elm Conf 2019 Slides</h1>
<h2>Music Theory With Types</h2>
<p>I am using RevealJS to do these slides. I will be able to embed demos directly into the slides.</p>
<h2>TODO:</h2>
<p>I plan on organizing the slides using the 11ty SSG. I can rip out a lot of the client side rendering and have 11ty process it.</p>
<p>I can also use my LilyPond rendering plugin to create music examples to explain things.</p>
